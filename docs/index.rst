Plant database
======================================

.. documentation master file.

Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for river engineering experience incresing popularity to leverage flood risk and ecosystem management in the light of climate change. Even though the demand for NBS is high, there design regarding scale and placement still is an important challenge. In some cases, missing knowledge and trust in NBS lead to overestimations of costs and time. This plant database constitutes an important step in the design of NBS with a plant data base for river engineering. 


.. This documentation is also as available as style-adapted PDF (`download <https://.readthedocs.io/plantDB/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_).

Installation
============

Use ``git`` to download the ``plantDB`` repository (make sure to
`install Git Bash`_):

1. Open *Git Bash* (or any other git-able *Terminal*)
2. Create or select a target directory for ``plantDB`` (e.g., in your
   *Python* project folder)
3. Type ``cd "D:/Target/Directory/"`` to change to the target
   installation directory.
4. Clone the repository.

.. code:: console

   $ cd "D:/Target/Directory/"
   $ git clone https://github.com/Lukas-create/plantDB.git

Now, ``plantDB`` lives in ``"D:/Target/Directory/plantDB/plantDB"``.

Usage
=====

Import
~~~~~~~

1. Run *Python* and add the download directory of ``plantDB`` to the
   system path:

.. code:: python

   import os, sys
   sys.path.append("D:/Target/Directory/plantDB/")  # Of course: replace "D:/Target/Directory/", e.g., with  r'' + os.path.abspath('')

2. Import ``plantDB``:

.. code:: python

   import plantDB as 

Example
~~~~~~~
Following are three code block examples giving insight on how to use the tool

Example 1: search for vegetation via coordinate input
.. code:: python

   import plantDB as re

   #to search for plant data via coordinate input, start by calling search_by_coordinates() in search.

   re.search.search_by_coordinates()

   #by calling the function the user gets asked to provide x and y coordinates in the python console


   #after providing coordinates in the console, point_in_bound() gets called to check if the coordinates are matching any of the provided shapefiles
   #if they are inside one of the shapefiles, matching vegetation from the database 'Pflanzendaten.db' gets printed in the console



Example 2: search for data in database
.. code:: python

   import plantDB as re

   #If you want to search for plant data in the database directly, call search_db_via_query() and provide an corresponding sql - query.
   query = "habitat = 'Alpenvorland'"
   re.search.search_db_via_query(query)

   #the above function call will print all plants including their parameters which are located in 'Alpenvorland'. plantDB supports arbitrary sql-querys over the datafields in the provided 'Pflanzendaten.db' database

Example 3:
.. code:: python

   import plantDB as re

   #to create the database Pflanzendaten.db call inputquestion() in sqlinput

   re.sqlinput.inputquestion()

   #by doing that you get to choose in the console if you want to add data via sql command or get the data from an existing csv file. The column names and entries of the csv file need to match the specified database format

How to document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package uses *Sphinx* `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ and the documentation regenerates automatically after pushing changes to the repositories ``main`` branch.

To set styles, configure or add extensions to the documentation use ``ROOT/.readthedocs.yml`` and ``ROOT/docs/conf.py``.

Functions and classes are automatically parsed for `docstrings <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ and implemented in the documentation. ``hylas`` docs use `google style <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_ docstring formats - please familiarize with the style format and strictly apply in all commits.

To modify this documentation file, edit ``ROOT/docs/index.rst`` (uses `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ format).

In the class or function docstrings use the following section headers:

For local builds of the documentation, the following packages are required:

.. code:: console

   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
   $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-setuptools
   $ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev
   $ apt-cache search libffi
   $ sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev
   $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev
   $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
   $ sudo apt-get install redis-server

To generate a local html version of the ``hylas`` documentation, ``cd`` into the  ``docs`` directory  and type:

.. code:: console

   make html
